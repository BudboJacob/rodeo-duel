# REASONING - Decision Log

## D-001: Game Mode Decision
- **Decision:** Lasso Duel as primary mechanic
- **Rationale:** Simple to understand, skill-based timing, works great for 1v1 competitive play. Father vs Son theme fits "who's the better cowboy" narrative.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Bull riding only (too passive), barrel racing (hard to make competitive)
- **Outcome:** Pending implementation

## D-002: Visual Style
- **Decision:** Cartoon western with warm colors
- **Rationale:** Friendly family vibe, appeals to all ages, easier to render with canvas primitives
- **Outcome:** Pending implementation

## D-003: Control Scheme
- **Decision:** Touch-and-hold timing + swipe mechanics
- **Rationale:** Mobile-native, intuitive, works for lasso throwing (hold to spin, release to throw)
- **Outcome:** Pending implementation
